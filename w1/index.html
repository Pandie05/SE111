        <p>Hello my name is Hendry, I really <b>HATE</b> the way you add comments in HTML. Anyways some of my favorite hobbies are Skating, Electric Guitar, Piano, and <i>hating</i> on the way you comment on html. Its too much work and my <u>fat codder fingers</u> have to move way too far. Although I know that ill get used to it and not hate it anymore its realy fun to sh*t on it for now.</p>
