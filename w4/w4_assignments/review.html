            <h2>Review</h2>

            <p><b>Hendry Reyes</b> | <i>January 29, 2024</i></p>

            <p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p>

            <p><em>Howl's Moving Catle</em> is one of my favorite Studio Ghibli films of all time. I remember watching Ponyo (another Studio Ghibli film) <br>
            and really enjoying it, so after my girlfriend suggested this movie, I was very excited to watch it. My first watch through of the film, <br>
            I instantly fell in love with the characters, visuals, and especially the music. The characters all have good development and stories <br>
            that make them instantly memorable. The visuals just like all Studio Ghibli movies, are stunning, everything is animated with such and life and emotion<br>
            that words can't do them justice on this review alone. The music in <em>Howl's Moving Castle</em> is instantly a hit, with the song "Merry Go Round of Life"<br>
            being the main track of the film (it's so good I learned it on piano :p). <br>
            I think this movie is a great watch if you're just getting into Studio Ghibli or if you're just looking for a great overall movie!</p>
